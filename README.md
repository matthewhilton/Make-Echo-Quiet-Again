# Make Echo Quiet Again!

Echo360 has a tendency to be a bit *loud* on the ears. Even if you mute it, it always finds a way to unmute itself and become full volume again!

This browser extension automatically mutes the Echo360 player during the excessively loud intro sequence of lectures, then automatically unmutes when the *actual* lecture starts.

## Installation
[Download Extension Here](https://github.com/unxpctederr/Make-Echo-Quiet-Again/releases)

 Note: You have to install it from this repository and is not available on the Firefox addon store or Chrome web store, as according to the person from Mozilla who reviewed the app for the Firefox addon store, it is 'too specific'....
 
 ### Firefox (recommended)
 For Firefox users (❤️), it is as simple as downloading the .xpi file. This is the extension for all Firefox extensions. It will prompt a warning (because its not hosted on the actual addon store for reasons listed above). Click **Continue to Installation** and then once loaded, press **Add**. It is now running in the background on any echo360 page, and will automatically mute! 
 
 You should now see the extension icon in the toolbar, if not simply follow these steps:
 1. Right Click Toolbar -> Customize
 2. In the list of options, you should see one for Make Echo Quiet Again!
 3. Drag this icon into the preferred spot on your toolbar

### Chrome
 Even though Google is an expert in tracking your ad preferences and browsing habits, they seem to be unable to form a coherent email with reasons to why the app keeps getting rejected from the Chrome web store (this is not uncommon). 
 I recommend just ditching Chrome and using Firefox, but if you really love Google knowing your browsing habits that much, here is a way to load this extension onto Google Chrome.
 
 1. Navigate to **chrome://extensions/**
 2. At the top right of the page, there is a switch for **Developer Mode**, ensure this is enabled.
 3. Some buttons should appear, press the **Load unpacked** button
 4. Navigate to the downloaded extension (available under releases tab on this repository)

### Edge

 1. Open Edge, search Google/Bing for **Firefox Download**
 2. Download and Install Mozilla Firefox
 3. Follow instructions above for Firefox
